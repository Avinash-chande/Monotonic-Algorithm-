# Monotonic Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of **monotonic stack based algorithms** in C++.  
The main focus is on solving problems like:

- **NSE** → Next Smaller Element  
- **PSE** → Previous Smaller Element  
- **NGE** → Next Greater Element  
- **PGE** → Previous Greater Element  



## Repository Details

- **Language**: C++  
- **Use case**: Competitive programming, interview prep, and algorithm study.  
- **Core idea**: Monotonic stacks to efficiently find nearest greater/smaller elements.

## Example Applications

- Stock span problem  
- Largest rectangle in histogram  
- Sliding window maximum  
- Range queries in arrays
